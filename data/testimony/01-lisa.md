In this video, we introduce *Redemption Stories*, and why hearing how people encounter the saving power of God is so encouraging.

Our first story comes from Lisa, who grew up in the church but did not come to grips with what following Christ looked like until years later when she encountered a group of Christians who were passionate for Jesus.

Among other things, Lisa's story reminds us that how we live each day matters, and that God uses other Christians in every-day moments to draw people to Himself.
