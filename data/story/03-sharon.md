This *Redemption Story* comes from Sharon Householder. One the one hand, Sharon’s story highlights how painful it is when those we love reject and abandon us. At the same time, her story (and her example) highlight how God does just the opposite. Even when we wander from Him, Jesus Christ remains ever faithful to us. And when we experience God’s love and forgiveness like that, it is a powerful engine for forgiving even those who have hurt us deeply.

> “No temptation has overtaken you that is not common to man. God is faithful, and he will not let you be tempted beyond your ability, but with the temptation he will also provide the way of escape, that you may be able to endure it.” <cite>1 Corinthians 10:13</cite>
