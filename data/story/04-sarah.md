When God pursued Sarah, He didn't use what many of us would consider flashy or impressive means. Instead, He worked the miracle of new birth by sending simple Christians who spoke His truth into Sarah's life. When we hear Sarah's story, it should encourage us that God will use even humble Christians (like us) in His pursuit of the lost.

> “For God, who said, ‘Let light shine out of darkness,’ has shone in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ. But we have this treasure in jars of clay, to show that the surpassing power belongs to God and not to us.” <cite>2 Corinthians 4:6–7</cite>
