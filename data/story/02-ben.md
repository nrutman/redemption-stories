Chapter 2 of *Redemption Stories* continues with Ben, a young man who grew up in the church but only recently has encountered the saving power of Jesus.

Ben's story gives us a picture of the deep inner change that God can work in a person, even when they look "cleaned up" on the outside. It also encourages us that God uses small, faithful steps of evangelism to draw people to Himself.
